The dataset includes 612 images.
Objects are annotated in folder format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 256x256 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -12째 to +12째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
